## Description
This repository contains my course project for UBC course STAT 538A Generalized Linear Models (Winter Term 1 Sep-Dec 2016-2017). This project studies the StarCraft II replay data collected by the Cognitive Science Lab at Simon Fraser University (http://summit.sfu.ca/item/13328). The objective of this study is to predict the player league level based on the explanatory variables obtained from the replay games and examine which variables are important in distinguishing different league levels.
